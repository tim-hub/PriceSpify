# PriceSpify

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pricespify/

This is an extension to beautify the price comparing website ([pricespy](https://pricespy.co.nz)) in New Zealand. This website have many users in New Zealand, but in fact the frontend design and UX of it is not really good, and this is why I develop this extension to do a little bit more to make price spy look better.

## Features
- centerlize website in large screen (not left)
- hide footer (waste too much space)
- auto redirect to mobile website if screen is small screen
